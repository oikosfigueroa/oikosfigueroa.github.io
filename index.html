                  Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Karen Figueroa Chilito</strong>, a data scientist and researcher committed to understanding the dynamics of mosquito populations and the diseases they spread, such as malaria and dengue. 
                  I am currently pursuing a <strong>PhD in Global and Environmental Health</strong> at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and serve as a graduate researcher in the 
                  <a href="https://paravec.sites.unlv.edu/" target="_blank">PARAVEC Laboratory</a> (Parasitology and Vector Biology Lab) under the guidance of Dr. Louisa Messenger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My work integrates machine learning, geospatial analysis of high-resolution raster datasets, and genomics to explore how mosquitoes adapt to new environments, what drives their spread, 
                  and the environmental patterns that determine their survival. By developing predictive models and analyzing genetic data, I aim to inform innovative strategies to combat mosquito-borne diseases 
                  and protect vulnerable populations worldwide.

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I explore the intersection of <strong>climate change and mosquito population dynamics</strong>, leveraging 
                <strong>machine learning, deep learning</strong>, and <strong>satellite imagery</strong> to understand and predict 
                the environmental factors influencing mosquito distribution and the spread of vector-borne diseases. My work focuses on 
                modeling relationships between environmental changes (e.g., vegetation, water sources) and mosquito populations to 
                develop innovative monitoring systems and adaptive public health strategies.

            <h2>Advocacy Work</h2>
            <p>
                üåç I was honored to represent Nevada at the <strong>2024 United to Beat Malaria Leadership Summit</strong> in 
                Washington, D.C., alongside my advisor, Dr. Louisa Messenger. This grassroots campaign by the 
                <strong>United Nations Foundation</strong> brought together advocates to address the urgent need for sustained 
                funding for malaria elimination initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of this summit, I met with policymakers, including:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Senator Jacky Rosen (NV)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto (NV)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Representative Dina Titus (NV)</strong></li>
                </ul>
                We advocated for continued investment in the <strong>President‚Äôs Malaria Initiative</strong>, the <strong>CDC</strong>, 
                and global health initiatives such as the <strong>Global Fund</strong>, <strong>Gavi</strong>, and <strong>UNICEF</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Messenger participated as a guest speaker in the plenary panel, sharing insights on bridging research and advocacy.
